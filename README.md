# VisionFront: Adversarially Robust AI for Security Applications

## Overview
VisionFront is a project focused on developing and deploying adversarially robust image classification models for security-critical applications. By fine-tuning pre-trained models like ResNet50 and VGG16, implementing adversarial training, and utilizing cutting-edge explainability techniques, VisionFront enhances the reliability and trustworthiness of AI models in environments where security is critical. The project is designed for applications such as surveillance, fraud detection, and autonomous systems, where adversarial attacks could compromise the model's performance.
